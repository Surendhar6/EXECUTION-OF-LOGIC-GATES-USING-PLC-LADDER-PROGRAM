# Aim:
To implement and verify the functioning of basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR) using a PLC ladder program and simulate the outputs.

# Apparatus Required:
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) - A PLC with support for ladder logic programming.

PLC Programming Software - Software like RSLogix, TIA Portal, or CX-Programmer.

Computer System - To run the PLC programming software and perform simulations.

Input Devices - Push buttons or switches to simulate inputs (I/O modules).

Output Devices - LEDs or any indicator to visualize the output of logic gates (I/O modules).

Wires and Connectors - For connecting input/output devices to the PLC.

Power Supply - Appropriate power supply for PLC and peripherals.


# Theory:
Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits, and they process binary inputs to produce a binary output. In PLC programming, these logic gates can be implemented using ladder logic, which is a graphical programming language resembling electrical relay logic.

# Basic Logic Gates:
AND Gate:
### AND Gate:

Function: Outputs HIGH only when all inputs are HIGH.
Ladder Logic: Represented by two or more normally open contacts in series.
OR Gate:

### OR Gate:

Function: Outputs HIGH when at least one input is HIGH.
Ladder Logic: Represented by two or more normally open contacts in parallel.
NOT Gate:

### NOT Gate:

Function: Outputs the inverse of the input signal.
Ladder Logic: Represented by a normally closed contact.
NAND Gate:

### NAND Gate:

Function: Outputs LOW only when all inputs are HIGH.
Ladder Logic: An AND gate followed by a NOT gate.
NOR Gate:

### NOR Gate:

Function: Outputs LOW when at least one input is HIGH.
Ladder Logic: An OR gate followed by a NOT gate.
XOR Gate:

### XOR Gate:

Function: Outputs HIGH when an odd number of inputs are HIGH.
Ladder Logic: Represented by a combination of AND, OR, and NOT gates.
